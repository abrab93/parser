Before inserting 116 484 log data (ma.wallethub.bean.LogLine object), 
i grouped data by ip and hour before saving it in the data base 
(ma.wallethub.bean.LogLineHour).
Therefore, i've only 19 256 line of data (LogLineHour object),
instead of 116 484 (LogLine object); which mean 83,469% of data optimmisation.

The system offer the possibility to save LogLine object by using --saveogLine=true,
otherwise the system don't save LogLine object for optimisation puprpose.

the system analyse LogLineHour object in order to extract hourly or daily duration.
by default all analyses requiered for hourly log is already stored in LogLineHour,
thus i don't need any additional manipulation.

On the other hand, daily analyse requiere more manipulation (sql) in order 
to extract suitable data.
